# Customer Churn Analysis Using Machine Learning

## Description
This project analyzes customer data to predict churn using machine learning techniques. It focuses on cleaning data, exploratory analysis, and building predictive models.

## Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw customer data.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Train and evaluate machine learning models for predicting customer churn.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and cleaned datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Includes notebooks for EDA and modeling.
- `src/`: Scripts for preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- `results/`: Charts, reports, and outputs from analysis.

## Results
- Achieved 85% accuracy with Random Forest model.
- Key insight: Customers with low engagement are most likely to churn.
